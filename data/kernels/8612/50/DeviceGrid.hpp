    //! Storing an unstructured grid on the device and do operations on this grid
    /*!
      The DeviceGrid class is based on the struct UnstructuredGrid from OPM, 
      and which is used by the current serial back-end for the Equelle compiler.
      Here, operations on the grid is given as member functions in DeviceGrid.

      The class contains the following data members as private variables for storing 
      the grid:
      - int dimensions_ 
          + Denoting 2D or 3D grid.
      - int number_of_cells_ 
          + Denoting the number of cells in the grid.
      - int number_of_faces_ 
          + Denoting the number og faces in the grid.
      - int size_cell_faces_
          + integer denoting the size of the cell_faces_ array. Might be removed on 
	  a later time.
	  
      - double* cell_centroids_
          + Points to array of coordinates of the centroids of all cells. Size of the 
	  array is ( dimensions_ * number_of_cells_ )
      - double* face_centroids_
          + Points to array of coordinates of the centroids of all faces. Size of the
	  array is ( dimensions_ * number_of_faces_ )
      - int* cell_facepos_
	  + Contains the range of indices for which faces belongs to each cell. 
	  The face indices are found in the array cell_faces_, and a cell c is 
	  surrounded by the faces from cell_faces_[cell_facepos_[c]] to 
	  (but not included) cell_faces_[cell_facepos_[c+1]]. Number of faces for 
	  cell c is therefore cell_facepos_[c+1] - cell_facepos_[c], and the size 
	  of cell_facepos_ is number_of_cells_ + 1.
      - int* cell_faces_
	  + Contains the indices for all faces belonging to each face as described above.
	  The size of the array is the value stored in cell_facepos_[number_of_cells_].
      - double* cell_volumes_
	  + Contains the volume of each cell. Size of array is number_of_cells_
      - double* face_areas_
	  + Contains the area of each face. Size of array is number_of_faces_
      - int* face_cells_
	  + Contains the indices of the two cells on each side of each face. 
	  Face f is the face seperating the cells face_cells_[2*f] and 
	  face_cells_[2*f + 1]. The orientation is also so that the normal of 
	  face f points from face_cells_[2*f] to face_cells_[2*f + 1]. If the face is 
	  on the boundary, then one of the two cells will have the value -1. 
	  Size of this array is number_of_faces * 2.
      - double* face_normals_
	  + Contains the normal vectors of each face, in non-normalized format.
	  In order to get the normalized normal vector, divide on the face_area_.
