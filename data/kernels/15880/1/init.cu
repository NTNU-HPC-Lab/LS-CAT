/// NAME:    dgemm
///
/// PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which a dense matrix
///          dense multiplication is carried out
///
/// USAGE:   The program takes as input the matrix order,
///          the number of times the matrix-matrix multiplication
///          is carried out, and, optionally, a tile size for matrix
///          blocking
///
///          <progname> <# iterations> <matrix order>
///
///          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
///          algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.
///
/// FUNCTIONS CALLED:
///
///          Other than OpenMP or standard C functions, the following
///          functions are used in this program:
///
///          cblasDgemm()
///
/// HISTORY: Written by Rob Van der Wijngaart, February 2009.
///          Converted to C++11 by Jeff Hammond, December, 2017.
